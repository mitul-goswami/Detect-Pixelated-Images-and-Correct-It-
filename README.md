# 📸 Detect Pixelated Images and Correct Them

![Project Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/800x200.png?text=Detect+and+Correct+Pixelated+Images)

## 📝 Overview

This repository provides two core models:

1. **Pixelation Detector Model** – Identifies pixelated images with high accuracy.
2. **Image Depixelator Model** – Restores pixelated images using an advanced U-Net architecture optimized with depthwise and pointwise convolutions.
